# Lab12 AsyncInn Hotel Management System Web Application

Welcome to the Hotel Management System Web Application project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing hotels, rooms, and amenities through a user-friendly API. In this README, you'll find information about the project's structure, setup instructions, and key components.

## Problem Domain
In the hospitality industry, efficient management of hotels, rooms, and amenities is crucial for delivering top-notch services to guests. This project addresses this challenge by integrating a database schema with a web application. The project follows a tutorial-style approach, guiding you through the process of setting up the application, creating database tables, and establishing API routes.

## ERD Diagram
Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) representing the structure of the database:

The ERD showcases the relationships between the entities in the system:
- **Hotel**: Represents a hotel with various attributes such as name, address, and phone number.  
- **Room**: Describes individual rooms within hotels, including attributes like room number, layout type, and rate.  
- **Amenity**: Encompasses amenities offered by the hotels, such as Wi-Fi, microwave, and air conditioning.
